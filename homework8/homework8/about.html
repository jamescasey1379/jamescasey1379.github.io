        <h4>
            I was born and raised in the DFW area until I came to college at OU! Growing up I was a huge fan of playing sports of all kinds, Soccer, football, golf, Hockey, you name it, I probably played it.
            I eventually got pretty good at hockey and that became my primary sport growing up and ended up winning a State Championship Title with my team my Senior year of highschool!
            I also have always had a passion for computers and the way things work. I built my first PC when I was a freshman in highschool and that began my journey to where I am today!
            I am currently set to start work as an Advanced Application Engineering Analyst for Accenture Technology upon graduating with my bachelor's degree this Spring and I can't wait to start!
            Nowadays I like to play golf on the weekends, work on cars and go out with friends!
